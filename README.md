## Usage

Include `datagridxl.js` in your web page HTML file:

```
<script src="https://code.datagridxl.com/datagridxl.js"></script>
```

## License

**Important: To use DataGridXL in live environments, a license is required.**

ONLY for non-live environments (internal development purposes), you can use DataGridXL without a license.

Without a license:

* you are required to show the DataGridXL text link ("data grid by [DataGridXL](https://datagridxl.com)") at all times
* you are not entitled to receive any technical support

**How to display the logo/link**

The text link should have a font-size of at least `14px` and the text "DataGridXL" should be clearly a link: underlined and in a color that makes it clear that it is indeed a link.
 
To get rid of the link, purchase a license.

To purchase a commercial license for the current version of this library, visit [DataGridXL Online Store](https://datagridxl.com/buy)
